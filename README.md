# 🐭 HTTP-Zoo

A creative and educational web app that visualizes HTTP status codes using fun cartoon illustrations of animals (especially mice and cats). Each status code is shown with a clear title, a short description, and a custom-drawn image that brings the message to life.

## ✍️ What I Learned

This project helped me practice and apply backend development skills such as:

- ✅ Building a Node.js and Express web server
- ✅ Creating and organizing routes (GET, POST, etc.)
- ✅ Connecting and interacting with a MongoDB database using Mongoose
- ✅ Structuring an app using the MVC pattern
- ✅ Using EJS for templating and rendering server-side views
- ✅ Handling environment variables with `dotenv`
- ✅ Logging requests using `morgan`
- ✅ Running a development server with `nodemon`
- ✅ Managing project dependencies and scripts

### 🎯 Backend First!

This project was mainly focused on **backend development** — building server logic, routes, and database connections.  
The frontend (CSS styling) is still very minimal at the moment.  
**One day, I will make the website prettier with better styles!** 💅✨

## 🖼 Example Status Codes(there is img)

- **203 - Non-Authoritative Information**  
  A cat says "Meow" next to a mouse peeking from a hole. The mouse hears it, but it’s not sure if the info can be trusted.

- **204 - No Content**  
  A cat looks into the mouse hole… but there’s no mouse. Nothing to see here.
